    "\"The good news is that the changes won't propagate to our time stream for another 25 days, and we have a device\" - she attaches something to your wrist - \"that will let you fix the changes with no such propagation delay. It's configured to send you 500 years further into the past every few days; that was the best we could do on such short notice.\"\n",

    "\"The bad news is that we are detecting roughly fifty anomalies throughout time; the device will indicate fixed anomalies with stars. The other bad news is that we only have one device and you're the best person for the job! Good lu--\" She taps a button on the device and you suddenly feel like you're falling. To save Christmas, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.\n",

    "After feeling like you've been falling for a few minutes, you look at the device's tiny screen. \"Error: Device must be calibrated before first use. Frequency drift detected. Cannot maintain destination lock.\" Below the message, the device shows a sequence of changes in frequency (your puzzle input). A value like +6 means the current frequency increases by 6; a value like -3 means the current frequency decreases by 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the device displays frequency changes of `+1, -2, +3, +1`, then starting from a frequency of zero, the following changes would occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current frequency  `0`, change of `+1`; resulting frequency  `1`.\n",
    "- Current frequency  `1`, change of `-2`; resulting frequency `-1`.\n",

    "- Current frequency  `2`, change of `+1`; resulting frequency  `3`.\n",

    "You notice that the device repeats the same frequency change list over and over. To calibrate the device, you need to find the first frequency it reaches twice.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Current frequency  `0`, change of `+1`; resulting frequency  `1`.\n",
    "- Current frequency  `1`, change of `-2`; resulting frequency `-1`.\n",

    "- Current frequency  `4`, change of `-2`; resulting frequency  `2`, which has already been seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the first frequency reached twice is 2. Note that your device might need to repeat its list of frequency changes many times before a duplicate frequency is found, and that duplicates might be found while in the middle of processing the list.\n",

    "\n",
    "While the very latest in 1518 alchemical technology might have solved their problem eventually, you can do better. You scan the chemical composition of the suit's material and discover that it is formed by extremely long polymers (one of which is available as your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The polymer is formed by smaller units which, when triggered, react with each other such that two adjacent units of the same type and opposite polarity are destroyed. Units' types are represented by letters; units' polarity is represented by capitalization. For instance, r and R are units with the same type but opposite polarity, whereas r and s are entirely different types and do not react.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "In `aA`, a and A react, leaving nothing behind.\n",
    "In `abBA`, bB destroys itself, leaving aA. As above, this then destroys itself, leaving nothing.\n",
    "In `abAB`, no two adjacent units are of the same type, and so nothing happens.\n",
    "In `aabAAB`, even though aa and AA are of the same type, their polarities match, and so nothing happens.\n",
    "Now, consider a larger example, dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA`  The first 'cC' is removed.\n",
    "- `dabAaCBAcCcaDA`    This creates 'Aa', which is removed.\n",
    "- `dabCBAcCcaDA`     Either 'cC' or 'Cc' are removed (the result is the same).\n",
    "- `dabCBAcaDA`        No further actions can be taken.\n",

    "After all possible reactions, the resulting polymer contains 10 units.\n",

Your goal is to figure out which unit type is causing the most problems, remove all instances of it (regardless of polarity), fully react the remaining polymer, and measure its length.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, again using the polymer dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA from above:\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing all A/a units produces dbcCCBcCcD. Fully reacting this polymer produces dbCBcD, which has length 6.\n",

    "You talk to the Elves while you wait for your navigation system to initialize. To pass the time, they introduce you to their favorite marble game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elves play this game by taking turns arranging the marbles in a circle according to very particular rules. The marbles are numbered starting with 0 and increasing by 1 until every marble has a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the marble numbered 0 is placed in the circle. At this point, while it contains only a single marble, it is still a circle: the marble is both clockwise from itself and counter-clockwise from itself. This marble is designated the current marble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, each Elf takes a turn placing the lowest-numbered remaining marble into the circle between the marbles that are 1 and 2 marbles clockwise of the current marble. (When the circle is large enough, this means that there is one marble between the marble that was just placed and the current marble.) The marble that was just placed then becomes the current marble.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the marble that is about to be placed has a number which is a multiple of 23, something entirely different happens. First, the current player keeps the marble they would have placed, adding it to their score. In addition, the marble 7 marbles counter-clockwise from the current marble is removed from the circle and also added to the current player's score. The marble located immediately clockwise of the marble that was removed becomes the new current marble.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose there are 9 players. After the marble with value 0 is placed in the middle, each player (shown in square brackets) takes a turn. The result of each of those turns would produce circles of marbles like this, where clockwise is to the right and the resulting current marble is in parentheses:\n",
